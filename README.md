# nRF24L01-Web-Data-Logger
MSP430 and Nordic nRF24L01+ Multiple Transmitter web data logger

The main objective of this project was to design a general purpose web based data acquisition and control unit. The idea is to enable a user to connect multiple RF based wireless sensor nodes to a central receiver connected to a web server. The web server will then enable the user to access incoming data from all the wireless sensor nodes connected to the central receiver.
